# Privacy Policy - Better Gallery

Better Gallery does not collect, store, sell, or share personal data.

## What the extension does

Better Gallery enhances supported image gallery pages and allows users to:
- view images in a custom viewer,
- download a single image,
- download a gallery as a ZIP file.

## Permissions usage

- `storage`: Stores extension settings (enabled/disabled provider modules) in browser storage.
- `tabs`: Reads the active tab URL only to detect whether the current site is supported and to show the correct popup state.
- `downloads`: Saves files only when the user explicitly clicks a download button.
- Host permissions (`games.tiscali.cz`, `foto.games.tiscali.cz`, `im.tiscali.cz`): Used only to detect and process supported galleries.

## Data sharing

Better Gallery does not sell or transfer user data to third parties.

## Remote code

Better Gallery does not load or execute remote code. All executable code is packaged with the extension.
